              Early Design Stage
            </button>
        </a>
          
        <p class="p1">
            Based on the results from early design, we came up with two conceptual models:- <br>

        </p>

        <p class="model_1">
            The first conceptual model was a personalized shopping experience, or a personalized shopper
        </p>

        <p class="model_1_info">
            Imagine a shopper who understands your dietary preferences, the cuisine of food that you like and even your favorite brands.
            Someone who could buy products personalized only to you, without you having to effortfully choose the specific items you want yourself.
            For example, imagine that you are allergic to gluten and needed to go grocery shopping, a personalized shopping experience would mean that the gluten-free alternatives for any item that you want would be readily available.
            And you wouldn't have to look for them specifically. Furthermore, you wouldn't have to go through the ingredients list of an item to see if you're allergic to anything in it or not.
            This conceptual models aims to address these issues to make the shopping experience smoother and more personalized.

            <button class="prototype_1">
                Lo-fi prototype 1
            </button>
        </a>


        <p class="model_2">
            Shopping using a recipe builder
        </p>

        <p class="model_2_info">
            This conceptual model aims to address similar filtering problems as conceptual model 1 but in the context of shopping for ingredients given a recipe.
