    <p class="aboutme">
      Hi! I'm Atherya Gollapally, and I'm a UBC student pursuing a degree in Cognitive Systems, I like to work on applications and occasionally make music. I'll post snippets of my projects, including some screenshots/gifs of my applications or anything else I do on this website as regularly as possible. My GitHub will be updated more regularly :&#41
