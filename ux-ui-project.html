        Design Project on SaveOnFoods' Website Interface

    <p>
      This group project was a major part of CPSC 344: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction. 
      This project involved working through the different stages of design; evaluating an interface, forming a problem, and finally, exploring and designing a solution.
      We chose to work on the interface of SaveOnFoods' online shopping website.

    <p>
      In the pre-design stage, our goal was to evaluate the interface of the SaveOnFoods website. 
      We chose to focus on some usability aspects such as findability and efficiency.

    </a>

    <p>
      In the early-design stage, we built 2 distinct conceptual models that are different and unique from the SaveOnFoods' current conceptual model.
      Conceptual model 1: Recipe maker. The idea behind this was for the user to be able to find ingredients by just searching for a recipe.
      Conceptual model 2: Personal shopper. The idea behind this was for the user to have a personal shopping experience that caters to their budget and dietary restrictions/needs.

      We then conducted cognitive walkthroughs for both of the lo-fi prototypes.
