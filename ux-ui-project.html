        Design Project on SaveOnFoods' Website Interface

    <p>
      This group project was a major part of CPSC 344: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction. 
      This project involved working through the different stages of design; evaluating an interface, forming a problem, and finally, exploring and designing a solution.
      We chose to work on the interface of SaveOnFoods' online shopping website.

        Pre-design Stage
      </button>    
    </a>
    <p>
      In the pre-design stage, our goal was to evaluate the interface of the SaveOnFoods website. 
      We chose to focus on some usability aspects such as findability and efficiency.
