            For our MidFi prototype, we combined the conceptual models from our earlier two LoFi prototypes. This MidFi prototype involves users being able to create an account, and have a personal shopper experience where users
            receive options to shop according to their diet, and get recommendations through this, and also shop for recipes. While shopping for recipes, users will be shown several recipes to choosef from, and within any particular recipe,
            users will have the option to toggle a button to shop according to their diet.
